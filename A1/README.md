**How did your team organize the documentations of the test cases (e.g. where did you store the test case markdown file for each team member).**

All the test cases are stored in a folder called 'Test Cases'. The test cases in this folder are divided into markdown files based on the category of cases they cover. For example, the R1 /login test cases are in a folder called 'login_tests.md'. 

Josh: R1 and R2 (/login and /register)
Evan: R3 and R4 (/ and /sell)
Alina: R5 and R6 (/update and /buy)
Sam: R7 and R8 (/logout and /*)

**Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub.**

**How are you going to organize different test case code files? (a folder for a specification?)**

Test case code files will be organized similarly to the test case markdown files: A single folder will contain all the frontend test cases, divided into separate appropriately named files according to the category of tests implemented.
